# sinclair-basic

A collection of Sinclair BASIC programs.

## about

These BASIC programs are designed to run on Sinclair hardware, such as
the ZX81, the Spectrum 128, and the Spectrum Next. Depending on the
game, they might support Sinclair 48K BASIC, 128K BASIC, or both.

The .bas files contain the listings of each program, but cannot be
used by Sinclair system itself. The .tap files are tape files formatted
for use with these systems.

The .tap files are compiled using the bas2tap utility found here:
